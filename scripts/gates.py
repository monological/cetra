"""Run the working-space contract gates (specs/10.1, 10.2).

    python3 scripts/gates.py [--keep]

Every gate here is SELF-VERIFYING: it compares two renders of the same build,
so there is no stored reference image to regenerate and no baseline to drift.
That is the whole reason these can run in CI where the pixel goldens cannot --
a golden needs a "before", a scale gate does not.

WHY THESE EXIST (spec 10.2): 10.1 shipped with nine goldens green and three
space-mixing bugs live. The goldens all pin exposure, so `preExposure == 1` and
multiplying by it is the identity -- they are structurally blind to the entire
class. The one gate that was not blind, scale invariance, ran on a single
punctual-lit scene, so it covered one of the four paths that write into the HDR
buffer.

The rule: a gate that pins exposure cannot see a space-mixing bug.
